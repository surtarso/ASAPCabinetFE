/**
 * @file loading_progress.h
 * @brief Defines the LoadingProgress struct for tracking loading state in ASAPCabinetFE.
 *
 * This header provides the LoadingProgress struct, which holds the state of the loading
 * process for ASAPCabinetFE. It tracks overall progress (stages), per-table loading,
 * metadata matching, and log messages for display in a loading screen. The struct is
 * thread-safe, using a mutex to protect access to its members, and is designed to be
 * shared between the loading thread and the UI rendering thread (e.g., via LoadingScreen).
 * Fields like progress bars' colors or log message limits can be made configurable in
 * the future by exposing them through configUI.

 * This struct stores the state of the loading process, including overall progress
 * (stages like fetching, scanning, matchmaking), per-table loading progress, metadata
 * matching statistics, and a log message buffer for UI display. It is designed to be
 * shared between a loading thread and a rendering thread (e.g., LoadingScreen), with
 * thread safety ensured via a mutex. The struct supports a mini terminal display in
 * the UI by maintaining a capped deque of recent log messages.
