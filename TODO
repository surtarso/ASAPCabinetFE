TODO [NEW]-> Feature/Idea
     [ED] -> Editor Specifics
     [FE] -> Frontend Specifics
     [!]  -> Important/Attention
      -   -> General/Logic

FIX:
- flatpak
- add failsafe when there is no audio (card)
- [FE] ffmpeg volume slider has incorrect values (too narrow range)

LAST THINGS FOR 1.3.0:
- improve the launchbox matchmaking! 
- make forceRebuild actually rebuild the scarry way now (and non-rebuild increment/update)
- adv menu 'edit metadata' purple, change name? edit match data? edit display data?
- vpsdb scanner starts on boot (should be vpin) but default scanner on editor should be vpsdb (its vpin)
- remove manual ID from metadata view (not persisted anymore)

for 1.3.1
- add ipdb after vpsdb scan for enriching (matched vpsdb may have ipdb url already, some of them)
- save lbdb values to table_data!
- see if that helps with launchbox hits (or just improve it after...)

QOL:
- some way to 'mark' perfect matches and soso matches for inspection (use confidence var?)
- add ipdb to the mix, change ids to ID_xxx (from xxxID)
- update header docs and user manual
- Add memory settings for storing N tables on RAM (default is '7' 3+(current)+3)
- [ED] add check if present rom is correct and recolor (vpin/vpxtool hook!?)
- [!] add basic/advanced toggle for main config ui
- [!] add instructions to the screenshot mode
- use more than title on catalog search (author, manufacturer etc)
- ease overwhelm in FE, send to Editor!

On hold:
- switch to use real DMDs
- refactor the monoliths... interfaces, templates, factories...
- refactor editor tooltips to centralized helpers
- refactor lots of shit to centralized helpers
- abstract matchmaking process to re-use
- organize current utils (maybe center data in data/ folder?)
- [!] add single table scan (all, selectable)
- add multi launchers (other emulators, other versions of vpx w.e.) '+' user add + dropdown
- portability: SDL drawn default wheel (simple logo)
- portability: embbed the UI sounds on binary
- portability: embbed and pre-configure app icon?
- screenshot mode using app size/pos as frame? kooha?
- [FE] make windows naturally draggable with mouse hold
- [FE] make windows resizeable with mouse and pass to config
- [FE] add attract mode (random table on a timer if idle) (optional)
- [FE] add key to switch sorting type (joystick oriented, cab navigation)
- add some way to download tables straight from the app?
- incorporate generate_media.sh?
- add highscore tracking
- add editor cli helpers (see editor_binary.cpp for details)
- add centralize colors in a /util/ for later theming support
- use new utils / media preview for vpsdb panel (unify thumbnail logic)
- send file download to utils (from vpinmdb)


- [NEW] UPDATE MANAGER PANEL
    - check for updates -> self, vpinballx (vpxtool, new std patches?)
    - click to download (maybe easy-install?)
    - notification even if not opened on scheduled check, like a text on adv menu or something
    - database updaters (done as standalone menu for now)


- [NEW] STATISTICS PANEL
    - add graphs/statistics panel about tables
    - played/unplayed count
    - most played
    - total playtime for all tables
    - disk space for core files/media files
    - database ages/size/count


- [NEW] MEDIA TOOLS PANEL — BLUEPRINT
Purpose: One unified workspace with previews for:

1. Image Tools
- Resize (720p, 1080p, custom WxH)
- Convert format (PNG → JPG, WEBP, AVIF)
- Compress (quality slider)
- Filters (blur, sharpen, denoise, monochrome, sepia)

2. Video Tools
- Resize (720p, 1080p, custom WxH)
- Re-encode (H264 / HEVC / VP9 / AV1)
- Trim (start, end)
- Change FPS
- Compress bitrate

3. Audio Tools
- Convert (MP3 / OGG / WAV / FLAC)
- Bitrate control
- Trim
- Normalize volume

4. Target Media Picker
- Auto-populated from selected table:
- Playfield image/video
- Backglass image/video
- DMD image/video
- Topper image/video
- Wheel image
- Table music
- Launch audio

5. Requirements: 
- be able to manipulate single table, selection of table, all tables
- use ffmpeg/imagemagick
- be able to manipulate single or selection of media. e.g:
    - only dmd all tables
    - dmd and topper for selection of tables
    - all images for all tables etc
