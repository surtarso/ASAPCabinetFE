- screenshot mode using app size/pos as frame
- key for metadata toggle?
- key to switch sorting type (joystick oriented)
- feedback for table launch/failure
- take overrides in consideration for matchmaking.
- use more than title on catalog search (author, manufacturer etc)
- clean up new panels (vpsdb catalog and metadata editor)
- save metadata back to .vpx with vpin/vpxtool
- single table scan (all, selectable) override manager?
- collapse/expand all widget for config ui
- make windows naturally draggable with mouse hold
- make windows resizeable with mouse and pass to config
- user-pick fields to be shown on metadata panel

On hold:
- basic/advanced toggle for config ui
- update header docs and user manual
- user-configurable options for video quality passed to videoplayer factory
- multi launchers (other emulators, other versions of vpx w.e.)
- auto-manufacturer logo on topper(or dmd?) thru metadata
- Use a macro or code generation to define the JSON schema once and reuse it for serialization/deserialization.
- attract mode (random table on a timer if idle) (optional)
- support animated png for wheel/marquee
- some way to download tables straight from the app?
- incorporate generate_media.sh?
