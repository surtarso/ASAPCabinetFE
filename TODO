TODO

FIX:
- vlc video renderer not working (Arch only!)
- make fast start and rebuild exclusive (unclick) between eachother
- ffmpeg volume slider has incorrect values (too narrow range)
- live reload font (along with windows) on dpi changes (recheck)

ONGOING:
- "editor mode" - port of vpx gui tools (--editor / -e flags)
- smart "renaming" for listing instead of filename (so user dont see "firepower" instead of "aerosmith")
- extractvbs functionality recolor on diff
- port ini editor + tooltips (keep 10.8.0, create new 10.8.1, switchable)
- add settings (editor related)
- configurable rescan folders button (file/vpin/vbs/refresh[start new])
- checkbox for vpxtool vs vpin?
- missing behavior: hover tooltips, selected vs unselect button clicks
- add the searchbar
- sorting on tab clicks
- color letter indicator legends
- color files with diffs
- color tables with failed status
- select/unselect in table (re-click)
- check if present rom is correct and recolor
- add playcound / success on the right of table scanner display line

QOL:
- a proper font picker
- refactor the monoliths...
- screenshot mode using app size/pos as frame
- key for metadata panel toggle?
- key to switch sorting type (joystick oriented)
- feedback for table launch/failure
- take overrides in consideration for matchmaking.
- use more than title on catalog search (author, manufacturer etc)
- clean up new panels (vpsdb catalog and metadata editor)
- save metadata back to .vpx with vpin/vpxtool
- single table scan (all, selectable) override manager?
- basic/advanced toggle for config ui
- collapse all/expand all widget for config ui
- make windows naturally draggable with mouse hold
- make windows resizeable with mouse and pass to config
- user-pick fields to be shown on metadata panel

On hold:
- move editor_binary.cpp to utils (and update cmakelist)
- add some of editor's new scraped data to main metadata panel
- update header docs and user manual
- user-configurable options for video quality passed to videoplayer factory
- multi launchers (other emulators, other versions of vpx w.e.)
- auto-manufacturer logo on topper(or dmd?) thru metadata
- Use a macro or code generation to define the JSON schema once and reuse it for serialization/deserialization.
- attract mode (random table on a timer if idle) (optional)
- support animated png for wheel/marquee
- some way to download tables straight from the app?
- incorporate generate_media.sh?
