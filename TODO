TODO

FIX:
- fix behavior of toggling rescan/online to off after save
- name parsing should fallback to filename with bad match
- small static gstreamer and pulseaudio leak
- ffmpeg volume slider has incorrect values (too narrow range)
- live reload font (along with windows) on dpi changes
- refactor the monoliths...
- Validation logs errors but doesnt indicate which specific check failed to the caller.
- enrichTableData catches all exceptions generically
- If logFile_ fails to write, theres no fallback (e.g., stderr). Add a fallback mechanism to ensure critical errors are recorded.
- Add a mutex for logFile_ writes to prevent race conditions in multi-threaded scenarios.
- use const for methods that dont modify state
- Combine vpxscanner counting and scanning into a single pass to improve performance.

QOL:
- Add ui user notifications for critical failures like missing config files.
- thread vps parser!
- collapse/expand all widget for config ui
- make windows naturally draggable with mouse hold
- make windows resizeable with mouse and pass to config

On hold:
- Use a macro or code generation to define the JSON schema once and reuse it for serialization/deserialization.
- attract mode (random table on a timer if idle) (optional)
- support animated png for wheel/marquee
- dynamic window creation
- table settings overrides
- incorporate generate_media.sh?
- integrate vpxguitools and vice versa thru process launchers?
- go crossplatform?
