TODO

FIX:
- vlc video renderer not working (Arch only!)
- make fast start and rebuild exclusive (unclick) between eachother
- ffmpeg volume slider has incorrect values (too narrow range)
- live reload font (along with windows) on dpi changes (recheck)

ONGOING: "editor mode" - port of vpx gui tools (--editor / -e flags)
- add settings panel (editor related)
- hook the loading screen
- hook vpin's extract vbs to wrapper!
- extractvbs functionality recolor on diff (use bool hasDiffVbs)
- spreadsheet column hover dynamic tooltips
- collapsable columns for less screen clutter
- main button tooltips positioning above buttons
- check if present rom is correct and recolor (vpin/vpxtool hook!)
- add playcound / success on status bar
- color tables with failed status
- columns for release date, last modified and confidence match?
- column for script patch status? status bar or files column instead?
- view metadata panel plan: display current media, separate each scanner info for inspection
- view metadata panel vs metadata override panel from main ui, separate or merge/use same?
- hook vpsdb browser (or remake = bad)
- mark tables unmatched in vpsdb (no vpsdb ID)

QOL:
- 'feedback' /util/ to receive a string and print as a message window universally!
- a proper font picker
- screenshot mode using app size/pos as frame
- key for metadata panel toggle?
- key to switch sorting type (joystick oriented)
- feedback for table launch/failure
- take overrides in consideration for matchmaking.
- use more than title on catalog search (author, manufacturer etc)
- clean up new panels (vpsdb catalog and metadata editor)
- save metadata back to .vpx with vpin/vpxtool
- single table scan (all, selectable) override manager?
- basic/advanced toggle for main config ui
- collapse all/expand all widget for main config ui
- make windows naturally draggable with mouse hold
- make windows resizeable with mouse and pass to config
- user-pick fields to be shown on metadata panel

On hold:
- refactor the monoliths...
- add some of editor's new scraped data to main metadata panel
- update header docs and user manual
- user-configurable options for video quality passed to videoplayer factory
- multi launchers (other emulators, other versions of vpx w.e.)
- auto-manufacturer logo on topper(or dmd?) thru metadata
- Use a macro or code generation to define the JSON schema once and reuse it for serialization/deserialization.
- attract mode (random table on a timer if idle) (optional)
- support animated png for wheel/marquee
- some way to download tables straight from the app?
- incorporate generate_media.sh?
- flag to open --config only?
- make both ui's switchable between them?
- splashscreen?
- highscore tracking
- editor cli helpers (see editor_binary.cpp for details)
