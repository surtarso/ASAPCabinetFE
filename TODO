TODO

FIX:
- 1st run cannot create config.ini from scratch if deleted.
- table match count not reseting after a full scan.(loading screen)
- name parsing should fallback to filename with bad match
- small static gstreamer and pulseaudio leak
- ffmpeg volume slider has incorrect values (too narrow range)
- refactor the monoliths...

QOL:
- Reset current section to default button
- auto disable vpsdb and/or full rescan after a full rescan
- thread vps parser!
- make windows naturally draggable with mouse hold
- make windows resizeable with mouse and pass to config

UI:
- properly render uiwidgets section elements
- overall polish on config ui (imgui)
- show a couple of prev/next table wheels?

On hold:
- review the entire config class and save/load pipeline (messsss)
- abstract linux commands with an interface for crossplat later
- use json instead of memory for standart info
- attract mode (random table on a timer if idle) (optional)
- create default videos?

Later:
- support animated png for wheel/marquee
- dynamic window creation
- table settings overrides
- incorporate generate_media.sh?
- integrate vpxguitools and vice versa thru process launchers?
- adapt to be crossplatform?

SANITY:
- RE-DO ENTIRE Config/ folder pretty much. WHAT A MESS!
