TODO

FIX:
- ffmpeg volume slider has incorrect values (too narrow range)
- live reload font (along with windows) on dpi changes
- Validation method logs errors but doesnt indicate which specific check failed to the caller. (1st config)
- If logFile_ fails to write, theres no fallback (e.g., stderr). Add a fallback mechanism to ensure critical errors are recorded.
- Add a mutex for logFile_ writes to prevent race conditions in multi-threaded scenarios.


QOL:
- refactor the monoliths...
- option to ignore scanners and read straight from asap_index json
- key for metadata toggle?
- key to switch sorting type (joystick oriented)
- feedback for table launch failure
- take overrides in consideration for matchmaking.
- use more than title on catalog search (author, manufacturer etc)
- clean up new panels (vpsdb catalog and metadata editor)
- save metadata back to .vpx with vpin/vpxtool
- single table scan (all, selectable) override manager?
- Add ui user notifications for critical failures like missing config files.
- collapse/expand all widget for config ui
- make windows naturally draggable with mouse hold
- make windows resizeable with mouse and pass to config
- user-pick fields to be shown on metadata panel

On hold:
- update header docs and user manual
- user-configurable options for video quality passed to videoplayer factory
- multi launchers (other emulators, other versions of vpx w.e.)
- auto-manufacturer logo on topper(or dmd?) thru metadata
- Use a macro or code generation to define the JSON schema once and reuse it for serialization/deserialization.
- attract mode (random table on a timer if idle) (optional)
- support animated png for wheel/marquee
- some way to download tables straight from the app?
- incorporate generate_media.sh?
