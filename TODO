TODO

FIX:
- ffmpeg volume slider has incorrect values (too narrow range)
- play both ambience and table music at the same time
- fix screenshotmode key being captured while config is opened.
- keep config.ini structure on save
- metadata year/manufacturer better parsing

QOL:
- sort by year/manufacturer
- make windows naturally draggable with mouse hold
- make windows resizeable with mouse and pass to config

UI:
- overall polish on config ui (imgui)
- add blinking arrows on sides to indicate table flow/keys?
- show a couple of prev/next table wheels?

On hold:
- abstract linux commands with an interface for crossplat later
- use json instead of memory for standart info (besides vpxtool)
- sound config for UI volume/music
- attract mode (random table on a timer if idle) (optional)
- create a make install target
- create default videos?

Later:
- add pup windows to screenshot capture
- incorporate generate_media.sh?
- integrate vpxguitools and vice versa thru process launchers?
- adapt to be crossplatform?
